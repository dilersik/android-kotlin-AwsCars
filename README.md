What is this App
###################

This App is based on Ricardo Lecheta's book "Android Essencial com Kotlin", but with many changes and upgrades.

I developed this project when I was studying Android and reading that book:

- Kotlin Android App; 
- Back-end: REST API + CodeIgniter (PHP) + Rest Framework; 
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk PHP (EC2 and RDS);
- Firebase Auth; 
- Push Notifications integrated with Firebase API;
- Google Room for local database;
